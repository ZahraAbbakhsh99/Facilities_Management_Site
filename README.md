# Facilities_Management_Site

This code provides a website for managing the facilities of an organization.

The main idea of this platform is to handle requesters and tasks efficiently. 
Requesters submit tickets, which are then prioritized in the facilities management section and assigned to workers.

In this implementation, only one feature has been developed: task prioritization using the Round Robin algorithm.

Additionally, this code has been created as part of the E-Commerce course project.
